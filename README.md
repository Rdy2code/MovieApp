# MovieApp
This Android application lists popular or, alternatively, "Highly-Rated Movies" in a gridview layout of movie posters. Users can click on the movie poster to view details and watch movie trailers and can select movies for collection in a "Favorites" list.

## Installation
Clone the repository to local, open in Android Studio, run and deploy to an Android device.

## Issues
Note that in order to access movie listings, this application requires an API key, which can be obtained at [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org). Once a key is obtained, it should be stored in a key.properties file inside the root directory of the cloned repository on your local before opening the project in Android Studio.
